#### Annual design conditions

Warm-season temperature and humidity conditions are based on annual percentiles of `0.4`, `1.0`, and `2.0`. Cold-season conditions are based on annual percentiles of `99.6` and `99.0`. The use of annual percentiles to define design conditions ensures that they represent the same probability of occurrence in any climate, regardless of the seasonal distribution of extreme temperature and humidity.

Values of ambient dry-bulb, dew-point, and wet-bulb temperature and wind speed corresponding to the various annual percentiles represent the value that is __exceeded__ on average by the indicated percentage of the total number of hours in a year (`8760`). The `0.4`, `1.0`, and `2.0`% values are exceeded on average `35`, `88`, and `175` h per year, respectively, for the period of record. The design values occur more frequently than the corresponding nominal percentile in some years and less frequently in others. The `99.0` and `99.6`% (cold-season) values are defined in the same way but are usually viewed as the values for which the corresponding weather element is __less than__ the design condition for `88` and `35` h, respectively.

#### Degree-days

Heating and cooling degree-days are calculated as the sum of the differences between daily average temperatures and the base temperature.
