#### Site selection

> Locating a project in a dense area near diverse uses addresses ways to reduce pollution by reducing the number of single occupant drivers.

__What are examples of diverse uses?__

Diverse uses are common services that people might use regularly. Diverse uses are determined by measuring 1⁄2 mile (800 meters) walking distance from the building’s main entrance. Here are some examples LEED defines the following as diverse uses:

<!-- more -->

- Bank
- Church
- Supermarket / convenience store
- Day care
- Dry cleaner / laundry mat
- Fire station
- Salon
- Hardware store
- Library
- Medical / dental office
- Park
- Pharmacy
- Post office
- Restaurant
- School
- Theatre / museum
- Community center
- Gym

__What are strategies to reduce parking?__

LEED encourages having the minimum amount of parking as required by local code. Project teams should consider:

1. Underground parking; or 
2. Sharing parking lots with neighboring properties when possible.

If parking is limited, there might be less automobile use.

__What project locations are best for reducing impacts to the environment?__

__How is pedestrian access provided?__

People must be able to walk between the project and the service without being blocked by walls, highways, or other barriers.

#### Alternative transportation

> This objective addresses transportation demand and access to mass transit.

__How can single occupancy driving be reduced?__

Building management can create incentives for building users to carpool. There are non-cash incentives such as preferred parking spaces. Another non-cash option is employee recognition. Other ideas are to reward carpoolers with discounted parking, or to reward carpoolers with cash or points for every day they ride together. 

Charging for parking can discourage people from driving to and from work alone. This will not work in all situations, but requiring employees to pay may encourage the use of carpooling and mass transit.
