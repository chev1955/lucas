<h4 id="indoor-air-quality">Indoor air quality</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Understand the human benefits of good indoor air quality and how to achieve good indoor air quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What should be included in a green cleaning program?</strong></p>

<p>A green cleaning program should be comprehensive and include:</p>

<!-- more -->

<ul>
  <li>Where the chemicals are stored</li>
  <li>What chemicals are used and in what quantities</li>
  <li>Training in the use of the chemicals</li>
  <li>Indoor pest control plans</li>
  <li>Equipment use</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What should a contractor protect during construction?</strong></p>

<p>the contractor should closely monitor the construction process to meet the goals established in the IAQ management plan:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good housekeeping principles</li>
  <li>Cleaning spills immediately</li>
  <li>Proper ventilation</li>
  <li>Dust control and mitigation</li>
  <li>Requiring Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as respirators</li>
  <li>Wrapping or covering ducts</li>
  <li>Preventing fiberous material like carpet and insulation from getting wet</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How can dirt be kept out of a building?</strong></p>

<p>Doorways are a prime point for contaminants entering a building. Consider adding metal grates or walk-off mats at every entrance to remove dirt, water, and contaminants from shoes. This helps keep the indoor air clean and reduce the cleaning chemicals used for cleaning floors at entry points.</p>

<p><strong>What must occur for tobacco smoke control?</strong></p>

<p>Eliminating secondhand smoke is a prerequisite for building certification because of its importance. The best strategy is to prohibit smoking in a building, and not allow any smoking outside within 25 feet of any air intake or door. For residential buildings, LEED requires partitioning of the rooms and no smoking in common areas. For buildings that might have smoking rooms, the exhaust system must create negative air pressure to keep air from escaping from doors when the doors open.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="lighting">Lighting</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Know the importance of lighting in a building both in terms of energy use but occupant productivity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What are strategies to increase daylighting?</strong></p>

<p>There are many means to incorporate daylight into a space, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Skylights</li>
  <li>Lightshelves</li>
  <li>Suntubes</li>
  <li>Larger window areas and appropriate interior wall space planning</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What must be addressed for a good daylighting design?</strong></p>

<p>Excessive glare can be uncomfortable, thus avoiding excessive light must be addressed in the design process. Ground surfaces, pavement, adjacent buildings, wide windowsills, and objects all can cause glare.</p>

<p>The heat load can increase, depending on the strategy used to allow daylight into the building.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="sound">Sound</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Describe the benefits of acoustics to occupants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What does a good acoustic design help with?</strong></p>

<p>Acoustics are an important element of indoor environmental quality.</p>

<p><strong>What design decisions improve acoustics?</strong></p>

<p>Better acoustics can be accomplished by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creating soft surfaces by using sound absorbing materials made from recycled products</li>
  <li>Using white noise to mask other sounds</li>
  <li>Paying attention to the geometry of a space</li>
  <li>Avoiding the use of small diameter ducts with high velocity airflow</li>
  <li>Designing rooms with privacy and concentration in mind, such as study rooms in libraries</li>
  <li>Enclosing or separating spaces where privacy and concentration is important</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What rating system requires good acoustics?</strong></p>

<p>The acoustic performance is only required by LEED for Schools, as teachers can’t teach and students can’t learn in noisy classrooms.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="occupant-comfort-health-and-satisfaction">Occupant comfort, health, and satisfaction</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Understand the strategies used to keep occupants happy and healthy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What types of systems provide occupant controllability?</strong></p>

<p>Occupant control systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Temperature control</li>
  <li>Lighting control</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What are examples of good thermal comfort design?</strong></p>

<p>Individual thermostats for offices and group multi-occupant spaces, such as conference rooms or classrooms. For those who are cold, radiating heat panels can be installed under desks.</p>

<p><strong>What is the benefit of providing controllability of systems?</strong></p>

<p>Occupant control is a significant factor in occupant comfort. Everyone is different and has unique temperature and lighting preferences. Control systems, and more generally how those systems are operated, can impact the company’s financial and productivity bottom line.</p>
